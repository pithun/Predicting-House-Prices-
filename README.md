# Predicting-House-Prices-

## ðŸ“œ Description
An ML task from a competition on [Machine hack](https://machinehack.com/) with comprehensive EDA and Model building to predict house prices. The dataset had some 
abstract datapoint which cause the models to have a very high RMSE. 

I ended the competition with rank of 13th.

## ðŸ““ Dataset

Task: Regression

Data Type: Continuous and Categorical

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation and Context

It's fascinating to easily predict prices of houses using basic regression models. This repo contains basic implemetation of concepts like using datascience 
libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.), data preprocessing (applying log transformation to normalize data distribution) and use of machine learning algorithms.
